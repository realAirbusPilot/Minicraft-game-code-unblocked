# ABOUT


Minicraft is a work-in-progress game inspired by classic sandbox adventures. In this game, you can explore, gather resources, build structures, and survive in a pixelated, open world. I am actively developing new features and improvements, so stay tuned for updates as the game continues to grow. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!


# Game Versions

This Google Doc contains all game versions posted. When in the doc, select the version you would like to play, then do keyboard shortcut Ctrl + A to highlight the whole page, then Ctrl + C to copy.
To run the game, all you have to do is go into a new tab and then do keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + I to open the Chrome Inspect page. From there, locate the page inside the Chrome Inspect page, which should be called "Console". If you have  never pasted anything into Chrome console, then you will need to type in "allow pasting". If you have already pasted something inside the Chrome console before, then all you need to do is paste in the code (Ctrl + V), then hit enter, and then the game should work!
